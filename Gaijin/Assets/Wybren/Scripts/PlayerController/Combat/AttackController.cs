    //Different classes for each weapon
    //Katana, Kusurigama, Shurikens, Smokebombs
    //Kusurigama, Shurikens and Smokebombs are abilities that have a cooldown on them. Katana is constantly useable.
    //When hit, sent damage and if stunned.
    //Weapons and abilities use their own trigger or collider to register when they hit an enemy. Same goes for the weapons of the enemies.
